## Frontend-Mentors QR-Code

This project serves as a practice exercise to enhance CSS fundamentals by replicating a design from Frontend Mentor. The objective was to create a QR code component using HTML and CSS, showcasing the ability to style and position elements to achieve a visually appealing and responsive design.

## Project Challenge

The QR code component consists of a card containing a QR code image and text. The challenge was to take the provided design and recreate it in code, paying attention to detail.

# Design to Relicate:

# Result:

## CSS Properties Used

The project demonstrates the use of various CSS properties to achieve the desired design, in particular:

- `position: absolute;`: Utilized to precisely position the card container in the center of the viewport.
- `top`, `left`, and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%);`: Combined to center the card vertically and horizontally.

# Deployment

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I focused on improving my CSS skills and gained insights into the following areas:

- **Positioning Techniques**: I practiced using absolute positioning and transformations to center the card container on the page. The combination of `top`, `left`, and `transform` allowed me to achieve precise alignment.

- **Key Learning**: I practiced using relative units like em and rem as well as static units like px and % to create a responsive layout. Using em allowed me to size elements relative to their parent container, while rem helped maintain consistency across different sections. The practice helped me better understand when to use relative versus static units to build responsive interfaces.
