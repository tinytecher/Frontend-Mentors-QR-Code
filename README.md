# QR Code Component - Frontend Mentor Challenge


This project serves as a practice exercise to enhance CSS fundamentals by replicating a design from Frontend Mentor. The objective was to create a QR code component using HTML and CSS, showcasing the ability to style and position elements to achieve a visually appealing and responsive design.

## Project Description

The QR code component consists of a card containing a QR code image and text. The challenge was to take the provided design and recreate it in code, paying attention to detail.

## CSS Properties Used

The project demonstrates the use of various CSS properties to achieve the desired design, in particular:

- `position: absolute;`: Utilized to precisely position the card container in the center of the viewport.
- `top`, `left`, and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%);`: Combined to center the card vertically and horizontally.


## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I focused on improving my CSS skills and gained insights into the following areas:

- **Positioning Techniques**: I practiced using absolute positioning and transformations to center the card container on the page. The combination of `top`, `left`, and `transform` allowed me to achieve precise alignment.

- **Responsive Design**: I learned how to create a responsive design by setting a fixed width for the card container and adjusting other properties based on that width. This ensured that the layout remains visually appealing on various screen sizes.

- **Typography Styling**: I applied typography styles to the text container, including font sizes, weights, spacing, and alignment, to enhance readability and visual aesthetics.

- **Box Model**: I utilized padding and border-radius properties to control the spacing and appearance of elements within the card container.
