Using these challenges as a way to get continually practice and develop my CSS skills

I thought the easiest and cleanest way I could achieve this look was to use absolute positioning on the card container and use that to place the card exactly on the where I wanted it on the page.

```css
position: absolute;
	top: 50%;
	left: 50%;
	transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```
